VectorDrawable does not support all SVG features, such as shadows and masks.
Therefore the ic_launcher files are slightly different from the master files: no shadows, minor color tweaks, path optimisation.
Use ic_launcher_*.svg files to generate assets for the app icon
Use master_*.svg files to generate other assets (e.g. feature graphic, playstore icon) or to rework the icon design
