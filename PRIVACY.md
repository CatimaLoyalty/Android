# Privacy Policy
Catima does not collect or transmit any personal information.

To ensure correct app functionality, we require access to the following:

- Camera: We need access to your camera to be able to scan barcodes. The app can still be used when camera access is denied, but you will have to manually type the barcode information.
- Storage (Android 5 and 6 only): We need access to your device storage to create or import backups. The app can still be used when storage access is denied, but you will not be able to create or import backups.

Catima offers a feature to share cards with other users. All the relevant data is in the generated shareable URLs and never transmitted to our servers. When viewed through catima.app, the data in the URL is rendered using client-side Javascript to further ensure no data is ever transmitted to us.

# Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy to https://catima.app/privacy-policy/. A snapshot of the Privacy Policy is available within the Catima app, though it may be outdated. When the Privacy Policy on the website and in the app differ, the website should be considered leading. You are advised to consult the Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at catima.g9ex3@hackerchick.me.
