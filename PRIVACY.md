# Privacy Policy
Catima does not collect or transmit any personal information.

To ensure correct app functionality, we require access to the following:

- Camera: We need access to your camera to be able to scan barcodes. The app can still be used when camera access is denied, but you will have to manually type the barcode information.
- Storage (Android 5 and 6 only): We need access to your device storage to create or import backups. The app can still be used when storage access is denied, but you will not be able to create or import backups.

Catima offers a feature to share cards with other users. All the relevant data is in the generated shareable URLs and never transmitted to our servers. When viewed through catima.app, the data in the URL is rendered using client-side Javascript to further ensure no data is ever transmitted to us.

## Crash reporting privacy

In the FOSS version of Catima (the version used on IzzyOnDroid, F-Droid and GitHub), the open source crash reporter ACRA is used for crash reporting. When a crash is detected, Catima will ask the user if they are willing to report the crash. If they choose to do so, the user's mail client is opened so they can review the data that would be sent. Crash reporting data is only sent when the user explicitly chooses to do so, it is **never** sent automatically. Crash reporting data is only used to solve crashes and no (potentially) sensitive information is ever shared. Users who do not want to be asked to report crashes can disable the "Ask to send crash reports" setting in Catima settings.

For the Google Play version of Catima, crash reporting is [managed by Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9859174?hl=en). Users can opt in or out of crash reporting through the Google app under the "Usage and diagnostics" setting.
