# Privacy Policy
Catima does not collect or transmit any personal information.

To ensure correct app functionality, we require access to the following:

- Camera: We need access to your camera to be able to scan barcodes. The app can still be used when camera access is denied, but you will have to manually type the barcode information.
- Storage (Android 5 and 6 only): We need access to your device storage to create or import backups. The app can still be used when storage access is denied, but you will not be able to create or import backups.

Catima offers a feature to share cards with other users. All the relevant data is in the generated shareable URLs and never transmitted to our servers. When viewed through catima.app, the data in the URL is rendered using client-side Javascript to further ensure no data is ever transmitted to us.

# Changes
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Catima website. You can view the Privacy Policy as of the time that version of the app was published directly in the app itself, though this may not reflect later changes to the online version. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes. You can check the history of this policy by checking this history of this file in GitHub.
