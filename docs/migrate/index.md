# Migrating from other apps

We believe people shouldn't be locked into any specific app. That's why Catima will always allow you to export your data.

We also try to support important your data from other applications whenever possible.

Currently, importing is supported from the following apps:

[Loyalty Card Keychain](protect_card_locker)

Is the app you want to import from not listed? [Tell us about it](https://github.com/TheLastProject/Catima/issues) and we will look into supporting it.
