Stop searching for plastic reward cards while checking out at stores or webshops.
Scan them all to your device using its camera, and leave them at home.

Type in the loyalty number manually if there is no barcode to store, or it can't be used.

Very few permissions. No Internet access.
Make a backup of all your cards and transfer it to a new device if you want.
